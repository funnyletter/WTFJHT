1/ **Trump's company was pursuing a plan to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow while he was was running for president in late 2015 and early 2016**. Discussions about the Moscow project began in September 2015 and despite signing a letter of intent, the project was abandoned just before the presidential primaries began in January 2016, emails show. The details of the deal have not previously been disclosed. The Trump Organization has turned over the emails to the House Intelligence Committee, pointing to the likelihood of additional contacts between Russia and Trump associates during the campaign.

2/ **Trump's business associate promised that Putin would help Trump win the presidency if he built a Trump Tower in Moscow**. “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,” Felix Sater, a Russian immigrant, wrote to Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, in 2015. “Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Sater wrote in an email. “I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.” At the time, Sater was a broker for the Trump Organization and was paid to deliver real estate deals.

3/ **Rex Tillerson said that Trump "speaks for himself"** when asked about the president's values and response to the violence in Charlottesville. "I don't believe anyone doubts the American people's values or the commitment of the government or the government's agencies to advancing those values and defending those values," Tillerson said on "Fox New Sunday," adding that "the president speaks for himself."

* **Trump's frustration with Tillerson is rising fast**. "Rex just doesn't get it, he's totally establishment in his thinking." ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/scoop-trump-frustration-with-tillerson-rising-fast-2478123564.html))

* **Tillerson could be replaced by U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley**. The Deputy Secretary National Security Adviser Dina Powell could then be promoted to Haley's job in New York. ([Axios](https://www.axios.com/tillerson-switcheroo-may-happen-sooner-than-expected-2478556632.html))

4/ **Trump pardoned former Sheriff Joe Arpaio**, who was convicted of criminal contempt related to his refusal to stop imprisoning suspected illegal immigrants. Trump didn't follow his predecessors' practice of consulting the Justice Department before announcing his first pardon. Arpaio was an early Trump supporter who also helped fuel unfounded allegations that Obama was not born in the United States. In a tweet, Trump called Arpaio a "patriot" and said he "kept Arizona safe."

5/ **Months ago Trump asked both Jeff Sessions and the White House counsel if Arpaio's case could be dropped altogether**. Trump was advised that it would be inappropriate and the case and charges could not be dropped.

6/ **Paul Ryan, John McCain, and Jeff Flake all criticized Trump for pardoning a Arpaio**. "The Speaker does not agree with this decision," a Ryan spokesman said in a statement. "Law enforcement officials have a special responsibility to respect the rights of everyone in the United States. We should not allow anyone to believe that responsibility is diminished by this pardon." John McCain added that the president's "pardon of Joe Arpaio, who illegally profiled Latinos, undermines his claim for the respect of rule of law." Jeff Flake tweeted that "I would have preferred that the President honor the judicial process and let it take its course." And, Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton called the pardon a "slap in the face to the people of Maricopa County, especially the Latino community."

7/ **Sebastian Gorka left the White House and will return to Breitbart News**, reuniting him with Steve Bannon. One White House official said Gorka submitted his resignation to John Kelly, while a second White House official said "Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he is no longer with the White House." The White House issued an unattributed statement saying that Gorka no longer works in the administration, but didn't say he resigned.
